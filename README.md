# 120-Day Job Crack Challenge

**From Zero to Job-Ready in 4 Months**

---

So here's the deal — I'm taking on a 120-day challenge to become job-ready in Python, Machine Learning, and Data Science. No shortcuts.  No excuses. Just consistent grind every single day.

This repo is my public commitment.  Everything I learn, build, and struggle through will be documented here. 

## What's This About?

This is a structured 4-month intensive program focused on: 

- Building rock-solid Python fundamentals (even if I think I know them already)
- Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms
- Deep diving into NumPy, Pandas, and data manipulation
- Getting hands-on with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn
- Exploring NLP, image processing, and even LLMs
- Cracking the math behind ML — linear algebra, statistics, all of it
- Building a real-world MVP project from scratch
- Preparing for actual job interviews and applications

## The Timeline

| Month | Focus Area |
|-------|-----------|
| **Month 1** | Python fundamentals → Intermediate Python → OOP |
| **Month 2** | Data Structures + NumPy/Pandas + Case Studies |
| **Month 3** | ML/DL frameworks + Math foundations + NLP basics |
| **Month 4** | MVP project + CV prep + GitHub polish + Job applications |

```

## Daily Commitment

- **Minimum 2-4 hours** of focused learning every day
- Daily coding exercises and quizzes

## End Goals

By April 2026, I aim to: 

- Have a solid portfolio of projects
- Be confident in technical interviews
- Land a job with a competitive salary (remote or local)
- Build something meaningful


## Why Public? 

Accountability.  When you commit publicly, you can't hide.  Plus, maybe this helps someone else on a similar journey.
