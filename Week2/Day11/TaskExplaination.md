### Task 11.1 problem Explaination

To implement add(a,b) using lambda is straight forward procedure just store the lambda as it saved in heap memory so then we can call it again. Usually lambda is creating anonymous function.

### Task 11.2 problem Explaination

Using map() we can calculate a lot of operations in short amount of time as its internally implemented by C. When we call map(func, data) it will return a iterator so then we have to cast it to list.

### Task 11.3 problem Explaination

filter() function will exclude the False value. As we use the function as the negetive value is False so it filter out the negetive value.

### Task 11.4 problem Explaination

functools.reduce is an advanced python function which calculate the value and generate a single result which is more optimized in term of space and time.

### Task 11.5 problem Explaination

To customize our sorted function we have to customize it key keyword their we can use lambda function. As we observed that the last two character is not digit so we exclude them and convert it into integer form then we can sort the list.

### Task 11.6 problem Explaination

zip() a built-in function of python takes two list or other data structures and make them couple in tuple term. then we convert it in dictionary.

### Task 11.7 problem Explaination

According to our testing we found that list comprehension is more faster than map with lambda combination.

### Task 11.8 problem Explaination

any() and all() two built-in function. If any() is called it just stop checking when it finds a True value and for all() it stops checking when it finds any False value. If does not need to explore the whole list for best or average cases. But in worst case scenario it takes O(n) time complexity.

### Task 11.9 problem Explaination

functools.partial has some of the advance option rather than using it inside function. Like we then need to define square with argument defination and others.

### Task 11.10 problem Explaination

Yes its possible to modify tuple inside map as it does not takes the tuple as tuple it takes input and generate new output that's why as shown in the code works perfectly.
