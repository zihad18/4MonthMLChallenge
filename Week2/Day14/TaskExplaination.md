### Task 14.1 problem Explaination

Using dictionary method takes O(N) time and space complexity

### Task 14.2 problem Explaination

Checking palindrom is easy process what if we donot care about space complexity we just reverse the string using slicing [::-1]

### Task 14.3 problem Explaination

first we sorted these two string then count the frequency of the charater then check them is them equal or not.

### Task 14.4 problem Explaination

We use recursion for flatten and use generator as well.

### Task 14.5 problem Explaination

order 15 then 3 or 5

### Task 14.6 problem Explaination

Using set + list for O(N) time complexity

### Task 14.7 problem Explaination

using binary search takes log(n) time only

### Task 14.8 problem Explaination

n\*(n+1)/2 - total

### Task 14.9 problem Explaination

### Task 14.10 problem Explaination
